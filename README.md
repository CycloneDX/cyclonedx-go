*cyclonedx-go is a Go library to consume and produce CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)*

> If you just want to create BOMs for your Go projects, see [*cyclonedx-gomod*](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod)

## Installation

```
GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go
```

## Usage

Please refer to the module's [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go#section-documentation).  
Also, checkout the [`examples`](./examples) directory for some examples of how this library may be used.

## Compatibility

| cyclonedx-go versions | Supported Go versions | Supported CycloneDX spec |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|
|    <= v0.3.0          |         1.14+         |            1.2           |
|      v0.4.0+          |         1.14+         |            1.3           |

We're aiming to support all [officially supported](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) Go versions, plus
an additional older version.

This library will only support the latest version of the CycloneDX specification. While it's generally possible to 
*read* BOMs of an older spec, *writing* will exclusively produce BOMs conforming to the latest supported spec.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. But please read the
[CycloneDX contributing guidelines](https://github.com/CycloneDX/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

It is generally expected that pull requests will include relevant tests. Tests are automatically run against all
supported Go versions (see [Compatibility](#compatibility)) for every pull request.

### Running Tests

Some tests make use of the [CycloneDX CLI](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli), e.g. to validate BOMs.  
Make sure to download the CLI binary and make it available as `cyclonedx` in your `$PATH`.  
See also *Setup CycloneDX CLI* in
the [workflow](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L37).
